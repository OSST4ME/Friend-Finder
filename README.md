# Friend-Finder
Friend finding app
Node and Express Servers
Overview
compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app.

This full-stack site will take in results your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

You will use Express to handle routing.

The survey has 10 questions. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.
